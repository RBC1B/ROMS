Dear <#if volunteer.gender??><#if volunteer.gender == 'M'>Brother <#else>Sister </#if></#if>${volunteer.person.forename} ${volunteer.person.surname}

Your current form for Kingdom Hall construction is ${message}. Hence, if you wish to volunteer with Kingdom Hall Construction, under the oversight of Local Design & Construction (LDC), you will need to submit a new form.

You can get the new form from your congregationâ€™s secretary.

Please note that this does not change your current status with the Regional Building Committee (RBC) for London and the Home Counties until all projects are taken over by LDC.

If you have any questions, please speak to your RBC department overseer or your congregational elders.

Regards,
RBC-LHC IT Support
